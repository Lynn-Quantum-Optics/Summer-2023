[x] implement a system to check if a motor even moved, so that we don't have to ping each motor for each measurement (which can take >20s)
[ ] gracefully close down the COM_PORTS when exiting
[ ] make some live plots of the data appear when running
[ ] finish documentation on basic usage
[ ] consider adding code to read termination bytes b'\r\n' for the ElliptecMotor to keep the ports clear
[ ] add a configure_setup method to manager to configure many motors at a time
