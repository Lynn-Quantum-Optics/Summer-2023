We tried to run basic_experiment.py, which should call a Bell's inequality experiment. We were unable to see any change in the coincidences that would indicate projections in differnet bases, so we began debugging. 

We confimed the big Thor motors turn on command after wiggling one of the USB cables. We discovered that on the USB hub that the Elliptec motors connect to, you must depress the buttons to the side in order to provide power. While we could not get the Elliptec motors to move on their own, we found that unpluggling and replugging the USB for the hub caused the the Bob creation HWP and the PCC motors to return to some position -- that is sometime today after we got the setup tour (and also, based on the lettering on the Bob C HWP, prof Lynn observed that it had in fact changed); however, we were unable to have these move on command.

The issue was that the Elliptec motors' ids had been all reset to 0, so we had to unplug each motor from the PCB, disconnect COMM5 using the program ELLO, then reconnect and set the addresses from A, B, C gradually, each time disconnecting and reconnecting. For more info, read documentation for Elliptec motors.
