[x] implement a system to check if a motor even moved, so that we don't have to ping each motor for each measurement (which can take >20s)
[x] gracefully close down the COM_PORTS when exiting
[x] make some live plots of the data appear when running
[ ] finish documentation on basic usage
[ ] consider adding code to read termination bytes b'\r\n' for the ElliptecMotor to keep the ports clear (but, it still works though...)
[x] add a configure_setup method to manager to configure many motors at a time
[x] add columns to the output table to record number of samples and period per sample
[x] smooth plots? or just not update so much?
[x] add bar plots
[x] add presets for measurement basis
[x] implement plot parameters from config
[x] add motor base class back (ach)
    [x] add motor offsets
    [x] add motor naming back (oops)
[x] handle connections better
[x] handle shutdown better
[x] update manager to work with updates to motor motor_drivers
[x] add raw data output option to manager
[x] make manager data management better
[ ] CHECK A_HWP PRESETS FOR "D": 66.4 ???
[x] update documentation.md with ElliptecMotor constructor
[x] print warnings when no output file is specified
[x] breakup manager initialization into safe sub-methods
[x] add debug initialization option to manager
[ ] go to lab to debug current code! wee
[x] add time method to manager
[x] add motors property to manager
[x] make manager non-init methods SAFER
[x] make time columns in output table legible
[x] remove all plot arguments (except ignore)
[ ] inform everyone about faceid
