[x] implement a system to check if a motor even moved, so that we don't have to ping each motor for each measurement (which can take >20s)
[x] gracefully close down the COM_PORTS when exiting
[x] make some live plots of the data appear when running
[ ] finish documentation on basic usage
[ ] consider adding code to read termination bytes b'\r\n' for the ElliptecMotor to keep the ports clear
[x] add a configure_setup method to manager to configure many motors at a time
[x] add columns to the output table to record number of samples and period per sample
[x] smooth plots? or just not update so much?
[x] add bar plots
[x] add presets for measurement basis
[ ] implement plot parameters from config
