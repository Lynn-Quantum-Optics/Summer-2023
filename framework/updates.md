- now **all output files get names** and must be loaded by the manager either by calling `Manager.new_output("<filename>.csv")` or by passing the file name as a the `out_file` parameter to the constructor. Note: **collisions will throw runtime errors!!!**
- now the **only way to get data out of the `Manager`** is by calling `Manager.close_output()`. This method has an optional parameter `get_data` (as a `pd.DataFrame`) that defaults to `True`. Note: `Manager.shutdown()` no longer does any data collection.
- calling `Manager.take_data(...)` will throw a `RuntimeError` if no output file has been initialized.
- **EVERYTHING IS NOW IN DEGREES!**
- now output data frames have columns that can be easily reffered to in python
    - `t_start` and `t_end`
    - `num_samp` and `samp_period`
    - Motor names for angles in degrees (e.g. `C_UV_HWP`)
    - `C<i>` for detector channel coincidence rates #/s (e.g. `C4` for $\ket{H}\ket{H}$ coincidence counts per second)
    - `C<i>_err` for coincidence count uncertainties
- just a general note that all positions returned will always be in the range $(-180,180]$
- `Manager` now contains a basic sweep routine `Manager.sweep`.
- `analysis` now contains many helpful functions including
    - `sin`, `sin_sq`, `sin2` (as well as `cos...`) which all work with degrees
    - `fit` for fitting one of the above functions (or one of your own) to data
    - `plot_func` for plotting fit functions
    - `find_ratio` for finding where two functions satisfy $p_1 = f_1(x)/(f_1(x)+f_2(x))$
- added `Manager.make_state(...)` for configuring one of the state presets from the config file
